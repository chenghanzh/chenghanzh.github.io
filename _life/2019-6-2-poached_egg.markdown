&#160; &#160; 打一碗水，把鸡蛋磕进去。如果是热水微波炉转1分钟（可以多10秒），比体温凉的水微波炉两分钟。
把鸡蛋从水里捞出来的时候鸡蛋还随着水波晃动，当真是咬破一汪清泉。

&#160; &#160; 缺点：微波炉会受热不均，鸡蛋碰到容器底部的地方更熟一些，上面的会生一点。

&#160; &#160; 进阶版：往沸水里加白醋和一小撮盐，微波炉转45~50秒。

1. **Make sure your eggs are really fresh.** Fresh eggs have a thicker white near the yolk that will better hold a round shape as it cooks. You can tell how fresh an egg is by putting it in a glass of water; if it lies horizontally at the bottom, it is very fresh; if it starts to float or stand on end it is less fresh. If your egg isn’t so fresh, crack it into a small bowl and drain off the runnier white.
2. **Crack your egg into a bowl or onto a saucer,** this makes it easier to slide into the pan. If there is any very runny white surrounding the thicker white then tip this away.
3. **Add a drop of vinegar** (you can add this to the water in the pan if you prefer).
4. **Bring a pan of water filled at least 5cm deep to a simmer.** Don't add any salt as this may break up the egg white.
5. **Stir the water to create a gentle whirlpool** to help the egg white wrap around the yolk.
6. **Slowly tip the egg into the centre.** Make sure the heat is low enough not to throw the egg around – there should only be small bubbles rising.
7. **Cook for 3-4 minutes or until the white is set.**
8. **Lift the egg out with a slotted spoon and drain it on kitchen paper.** Trim off any straggly bits of white. If you need to cook more than one poached egg, keep it at the right temperature in warm water, but make sure the water isn't hot enough to overcook the egg.

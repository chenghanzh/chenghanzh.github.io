&#160; &#160; Augmenting Human Intellect: boosting mankind's capability for coping with complex, urgent problems.

&#160; &#160; Links give you new freedom in building structures

&#160; &#160; Many of Kleinrock's initial ideas came from brainstorming about the best way for students and researchers at MIT to most efficiently share computer time. "Computers burst data, they transmit then they stop a while, while they're thinking or processing or whatever. And in those days data communication lines were really expensive," said Kleinrock. "The idea was, don't dedicate a resource to somebody -- when I was sitting there, scratching my head, that machine was idle, I'm not using it. You want to do it in dynamic fashion: whoever needs it gets it now. If you're not using it, let somebody else in."

&#160; &#160; Baran's study describes a remarkably detailed architecture for a distributed, survivable, packet switched communications network. The network is designed to withstand almost any degree of destruction to individual components without loss of end-to-end communications. Since each computer could be connected to one or more other computers, Baran assumed that any link of the network could fail at any time, and the network therefore had no central control or administration (see the lower scheme).

Using a mini-computer, Baran and his team developed simulation programs to test basic connectivity of an array of nodes with varying degrees of linking. That is, a network of n-ary degree of connectivity would have n links per node. The simulation randomly destroyed nodes and subsequently tested the percentage of nodes who remained connected. The result of the simulation revealed that networks where n>=3 had a significant increase in resilience against even as much as 50% node loss. Baran's conviction gained from the simulation was that redundancy was the key.

&#160; &#160; Lick headed SAGE's human-factors team, and he saw the project as an example of how machines and humans could work in partnership. Without computers, humans couldn't begin to integrate all that radar information. Without humans, computers couldn't recognize the significance of that information, or make decisions.

Man-computer symbiosis is an expected development in cooperative interaction between men and electronic computers. It will involve very close coupling between the human and the electronic members of the partnership. The main aims are 1) to let computers facilitate formulative thinking as they now facilitate the solution of formulated problems, and 2) to enable men and computers to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. In the anticipated symbiotic partnership, men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking. Preliminary analyses indicate that the symbiotic partnership will perform intellectual operations much more effectively than man alone can perform them. Prerequisites for the achievement of the effective, cooperative association include developments in computer time sharing, in memory components, in memory organization, in programming languages, and in input and output equipment.
